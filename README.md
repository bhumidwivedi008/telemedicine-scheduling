🩺 Telemedicine Scheduling & Virtual Visit Platform — Requirements Pack

A complete requirements and system design document for a Telemedicine Scheduling & Virtual Consultation Platform. It enables patients to book appointments, join secure virtual visits, and receive post-visit documentation such as prescriptions and clinical notes.

The platform focuses on accurate slot availability, fast and reliable video sessions, secure medical data handling, and clear separation of services (Scheduling, Video, Records, Notifications).

Key components include appointment discovery, booking workflows, virtual-visit token management, post-visit documentation, admin controls, audit logging, compliance (HIPAA/GDPR), and scalable microservice-based architecture.
